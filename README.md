# FriBidiSharp
A .NET binding for FriBidi.

https://www.nuget.org/packages/FriBidiSharp/

This wrapper contains native fribidi.dll builds from vcpkg for Windows x86, and Windows x64. However, it also targets Linux x64, but does not include a native fribidi library for it, but rather assume it is installed in the system.
